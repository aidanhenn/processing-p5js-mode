X move away from static worker objects, likely causing collisions


_ oops, port is not being reused per sketch

_ showing a css tab was causing a lot of error messages

_ when sketch is moved while the editor is open
_   it can't re-create any of the supporting files
_   leaving you with a broken sketch, which is messy b/c it looks ok

_ need better solution when opening sketch.js files
_   just rename the sketch.js file itself
_   https://github.com/fathominfo/processing-p5js-mode/issues/14

_ properly implement the minified versions of libs
_   git checkout e560d0576c2440081787e7b09eefdc760152f022^ -- <file_path>
_   (that's the commit that started deleting, ^ will get us to previous)

_ when rewriting the index.html file, 'sketch modified externally' messages
_   https://github.com/fathominfo/processing-p5js-mode/issues/15

_ update the examples (they've not been updated in a while)

_ other import library changes
_   it's actually 'add library' not 'import' in this case
_   probably need a way to *remove* the libraries too
_   get contributed libraries working?

_ refactor library imports in p5
_   properly refactor rebuildLibraryList() and the isCompatible() code
_     which is currently only found in ExampleContribution, but should be
_     implemented in a more general way for the other contribs
_     clean up the static stuff since it's not just Examples
_   Library.discover(File) is static and expects .jar files
_     even once that's fixed, need to make sure js libs don't show up w/ Java
_     meaning that there needs to be other ironing in there

_ if starting a new sketch, must reload the browser first?
_   what's happening here? concerned about code mods not updating
_   set no cache on returned objects?

_ ability to update p5*.js in the libraries subfolder
_   automatically notify user if version in the template is updated?

_ how do we bring back the auto-update block if it's broken?
_   or if it's not present, stop updating that file?

_ make it possible for the main class to be something besides the default name
_   want to use sketch.js (this is a fine restriction)
_   how difficult to have modes determine whether a sketch is a sketch?
_     so that the main sketch class doesn't have to follow a naming convention
_   Mode.rebuildSketchbookTree() handles creation of the sketchbook menu
_   which calls Base.addSketches() to do the actual adding
_   would need some means of specifying what the 'main' file is
_     at least with p5js we could provisionally just use sketch.js?

_ mode option for showing html and css or not
_   is it time to add Mode preferences?
_ other supported types from p5js editor
_   txt, html, css, js, json, scss, xml, csv, less
_   include: html, css, js, json, scss, less
_   exclude: xml, txt, csv (like to be in data folder)
_ add basic syntax highlighting for css
